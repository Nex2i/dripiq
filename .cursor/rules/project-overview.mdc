This project is a monorepo with the client and backend. 

Before starting any work always return back first your plan before writing or commiting any code.

Before pushing a new commit run the scripts inside `ci.yml`. If any fail fix the issue, if it is a lint run the `lint --fix` command for the linter to fix for you.

Avoid at all costs adding comments saying that a new code block is new or when removing dont include a comment saying code used to be there. Avoid status comments of new, updated, removed.

Avoid importing/requiring anything not at the top of the file. Do not lazy load components outside of the @/landing project.
