If you are a resident of the UK, you may direct your questions or concerns to the UK Information Commissioner's Office.

### Opting Out of Receiving Electronic Communications

You may also initiate any opt outs by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). We honor Opt-Out Preference Signals, including GPC. If you choose to use an Opt-Out Preference Signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use.

You will not be discriminated against in any way by virtue of your exercise of the rights listed in this Policy which means we will not deny goods or services to you, provide different prices or rates for goods or services to you, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services to you. Only you, or an authorized agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal data. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.

We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests, and if we cannot verify your identity, we may request additional information from you. If you are an authorized agent making a request on behalf of another person, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney. We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your requests unless they are excessive or repetitive. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. We may deny certain requests, or only fulfill some in part, as permitted or required by law. If you are not satisfied with the resolution of your request and you are afforded a right to appeal such decision, you will be notified of our appeal process in our response to your request.
