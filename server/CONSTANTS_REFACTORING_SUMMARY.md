# Event Type Constants Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully created centralized constants for campaign event types to eliminate hardcoded strings throughout the codebase and prevent typos/inconsistencies.

## Files Created/Modified

### ✅ New Constants File
- **`src/constants/campaign-events.ts`** - Central location for all event type constants

### ✅ Files Updated to Use Constants

1. **`src/constants/staticCampaignTemplate.ts`**
   - Updated `CAMPAIGN_CONSTANTS.EVENTS` to use imported constants
   - Replaced `'clicked'` and `'no_click'` with constants

2. **`src/modules/webhooks/sendgrid.webhook.service.ts`**
   - Added import for event constants and helper functions
   - Replaced hardcoded event type normalization map with `normalizeEventTypeForCampaign()` function
   - Updated ignored events list to use `IGNORED_TRANSITION_EVENTS` constant
   - Added comprehensive logging for event type normalization

3. **`src/workers/campaign-execution/timeout-execution.service.ts`**
   - Added import for `CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES`
   - Replaced `CAMPAIGN_CONSTANTS.EVENTS.NO_CLICK` with `CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES.NO_CLICK`
   - Updated click event references to use constants

4. **`src/workers/campaign-execution/email-execution.service.ts`**
   - Added imports for `CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES` and `TIMEOUT_EVENT_TYPES`
   - Replaced hardcoded timeout event type array with imported constant
   - Updated all timeout event strings to use constants (`'no_open'` → `CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES.NO_OPEN`)

5. **`src/modules/ai/schemas/contactCampaignStrategySchema.ts`**
   - Added import for `CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES`
   - Updated `EventType` enum to use constants instead of hardcoded strings

6. **`src/modules/webhooks/sendgrid.webhook.types.ts`**
   - Added import for SendGrid constants (as `SENDGRID_CONSTANTS` to avoid naming conflicts)
   - Updated TypeScript type definitions to use constants
   - Updated event arrays to use constants
   - Updated key interface definitions (`SendGridOpenEvent`, `SendGridClickEvent`, etc.)

7. **`src/modules/webhooks/__tests__/sendgrid.webhook.service.test.ts`**
   - Updated test to verify event type normalization works correctly

## Constants Defined

### SendGrid Event Types (Raw from webhooks)
```typescript
export const SENDGRID_EVENT_TYPES = {
  DELIVERED: 'delivered',
  BOUNCE: 'bounce',
  DEFERRED: 'deferred', 
  DROPPED: 'dropped',
  OPEN: 'open',
  CLICK: 'click',
  SPAM_REPORT: 'spam_report',
  UNSUBSCRIBE: 'unsubscribe',
  GROUP_UNSUBSCRIBE: 'group_unsubscribe',
  GROUP_RESUBSCRIBE: 'group_resubscribe',
}
```

### Campaign Event Types (Used in transitions)
```typescript
export const CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES = {
  OPENED: 'opened',
  CLICKED: 'clicked',
  DELIVERED: 'delivered',
  BOUNCE: 'bounce',
  DROPPED: 'dropped',
  DEFERRED: 'deferred',
  NO_OPEN: 'no_open',
  NO_CLICK: 'no_click',
  SPAM: 'spam',
  UNSUBSCRIBE: 'unsubscribe',
}
```

## Helper Functions Added

1. **`normalizeEventTypeForCampaign(eventType: string)`**
   - Maps SendGrid event types to campaign plan event types
   - Handles `'open'` → `'opened'` conversion that fixed the original bug

2. **`shouldTriggerCampaignTransition(eventType: string)`**
   - Determines if an event should trigger campaign transitions

3. **`isTimeoutEvent(eventType: string)`**
   - Checks if an event is a synthetic timeout event

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Bug Fix
- **Fixed the original issue**: `'open'` events from SendGrid are now properly normalized to `'opened'` for campaign transitions
- Prevents similar issues in the future

### ✅ Type Safety
- TypeScript interfaces now use constants, preventing typos at compile time
- Centralized source of truth for all event types

### ✅ Maintainability
- Single location to update event type strings
- Easy to add new event types consistently
- Clear separation between SendGrid events and campaign events

### ✅ Testing
- Added test to verify event type normalization works correctly
- Helper script to find remaining hardcoded strings

## Remaining Work (Optional)

### Files with Remaining Hardcoded Strings
The following files still contain some hardcoded event type strings that could be refactored:

- Test files (lower priority - mainly for mocking)
- Some webhook type definitions (partially updated)
- Legacy code that might not be actively used

### Helper Script
Created `find-hardcoded-events.js` to identify remaining hardcoded strings:
```bash
node find-hardcoded-events.js
```

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Zero Breaking Changes
- All changes are backwards compatible
- Existing functionality unchanged except for the bug fix

### ✅ Improved Reliability  
- Eliminates event type mismatches that caused the original campaign issue
- Reduces risk of typos in event handling

### ✅ Better Developer Experience
- IntelliSense/autocomplete for event types
- Clear import statements show dependencies
- Centralized documentation of all event types

## Usage Examples

### Before (Hardcoded)
```typescript
if (eventType === 'no_click') {
  // Handle no-click event
}

const normalizedType = messageEvent.type === 'open' ? 'opened' : messageEvent.type;
```

### After (Using Constants)
```typescript
import { CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES, normalizeEventTypeForCampaign } from '@/constants/campaign-events';

if (eventType === CAMPAIGN_EVENT_TYPES.NO_CLICK) {
  // Handle no-click event
}

const normalizedType = normalizeEventTypeForCampaign(messageEvent.type);
```

This refactoring successfully addresses the root cause of the campaign execution issue while improving code quality and maintainability across the entire codebase.
