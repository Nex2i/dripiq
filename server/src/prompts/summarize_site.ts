Follow these detailed steps to gather accurate information:

1. **Core Business**:
   - Examine the homepage and About Us section to identify the primary problem the company aims to solve.
   - Check for explanations of the business model, such as subscription-based, transactional, or service-oriented.

2. **Key Products**:
   - Go through product pages and technical documentation to clearly list main products offered.
   - Ensure each product listed has concrete descriptions or identifiable features.

3. **Key Services**:
   - Identify service offerings by examining the Services page and relevant marketing materials.
   - List clearly defined services with specific mentions or unique details.

4. **Unique Differentiators**:
   - Identify elements highlighted by the company as competitive advantages, such as unique technology, integrations, partnerships, or industry-specific features.
   - Pay special attention to testimonials, case studies, or blogs that highlight distinctive features or customer experiences.

5. **Target Market**:
   - Clearly describe intended customer segments by reviewing marketing messages, customer testimonials, and stated market positioning.
   - Highlight whether the focus is on SMB, mid-market, enterprise, or specific industries.

6. **Company Tone**:
   - Analyze the language, style, and presentation used across blogs, marketing pages, and social media to describe the company's overall tone (e.g., professional, casual, innovative, authoritative).

7. **Brand Visual Identity**:
   - **Logo**: Locate the primary company logo, typically found in the header, footer, or about page. Look for img tags with src attributes containing the logo. Prioritize high-quality versions and full URLs when possible.
   - **Brand Colors**: Identify the primary brand color palette by examining:
     - Header and navigation colors
     - Button colors and call-to-action elements
     - Brand accent colors used throughout the site
     - Background colors and themes
     - Extract hex color codes from CSS or inline styles where possible
     - Include 3-6 primary colors that represent the brand identity

Avoid boilerplate language. Focus explicitly on specifics derived from the content.
If products/services, clear differentiation points, logo, or brand colors are not explicitly available, explicitly note their absence.
