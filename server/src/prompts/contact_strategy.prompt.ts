7. **email_7** - Urgency email creating time-sensitive motivation to act
8. **email_8** - Direct ask email with clear call-to-action and next steps
9. **email_9** - Last chance email with final value proposition and urgency
10. **email_10** - Professional breakup email maintaining relationship for future opportunities

CRITICAL: Only use these exact email IDs. Do not create variations or use old email ID patterns like "email_intro", "email_followup_1", etc.
