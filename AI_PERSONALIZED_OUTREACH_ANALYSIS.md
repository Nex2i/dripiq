# AI-Personalized Outreach Campaign System Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current implementation status of the AI-personalized outreach campaign system against the provided specification. The system aims to deliver per-contact, AI-personalized email campaigns that react to engagement through SendGrid, with scalability targets of ~10 tenants × 100k leads = 1M leads and 50M+ touchpoints.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal**: Per-contact, AI-personalized outreach campaigns that react to engagement (open/click/reply/etc.), starting with email via SendGrid, extendable to SMS next and other channels later.

**Scale Targets**: 
- ~10 tenants × 100k leads = 1M leads
- ~5–20 contacts/lead

   - SendGrid validation API integration
   - Caching validation results

3. **`contact_channels`** - ✅ Implemented  
   - Multi-address support per contact

## 🔄 BullMQ Orchestration Analysis

### ✅ **Implemented Queues**

The system implements the three core queues specified:

1. **`lead_analysis`** Queue
   - Processes lead analysis jobs using `LeadAnalyzerService.analyze()`
   - Automatically creates campaign jobs for discovered contacts
   - Concurrency: 2 jobs, 3 retry attempts

2. **`campaign_creation`** Queue  
   - Processes campaign creation using `generateContactStrategy()`
   - Automatically persists campaigns to database
   - Concurrency: 3 jobs, staggered execution to prevent AI overload

3. **`campaign_execution`** Queue
   - Handles email sending via `EmailExecutionService`
   - Processes timeout events via `TimeoutExecutionService`
   - Rate-limited per-tenant and per-sender

### ✅ **Worker Implementation**

```typescript

  ├── EmailExecutionService (email sending)
  ├── TimeoutExecutionService (synthetic events)
  └── Job routing by job.name
```

### ✅ **Idempotency & Exactly-Once Processing**

The system implements robust idempotency:

- **Message sends**: `${tenant}:${contact}:${campaign}:${node}:${channel}`
- **Scheduled actions**: Uses `bullmqJobId` tracking
- **Webhooks**: `payload_hash` uniqueness + `sg_event_id` deduplication
- **Database transactions**: Two-phase commits for job creation
