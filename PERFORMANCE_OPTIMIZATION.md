# API Performance Optimization - Leads Endpoint

## Issue
The `/api/leads` endpoint was taking nearly 1 second to return a single record locally, indicating significant performance bottlenecks.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Redundant Database Queries**: Every request was making two separate database calls:
   - Authentication plugin: Loading user and tenant data (with 5-minute cache)
   - Service layer: Additional `validateUserTenantAccess()` call for the same data

2. **Missing Database Indexes**: The leads table lacked proper indexes for common query patterns:
   - No index on `tenant_id` (primary filter)
   - No composite index on `tenant_id + created_at` (for ordered queries)
   - No indexes for text search functionality

3. **Inefficient Query Patterns**: Queries were not optimized for the access patterns.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Eliminated Redundant Database Calls ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```typescript
export const getLeads = async (userId: string, tenantId: string, searchQuery?: string) => {
  // This makes a database query even though auth plugin already validated access
  await validateUserTenantAccess(userId, tenantId);
  
  const result = await db.select().from(leads)...
  return result;
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const getLeads = async (userId: string, tenantId: string, searchQuery?: string) => {
  // Note: Tenant validation is now handled in authentication plugin to avoid redundant DB queries
  // validateUserTenantAccess is skipped here since auth plugin already verified tenant access
  
  const result = await db.select().from(leads)...
  return result;
};
```

**Impact:** Reduces database calls per request from 2 to 1 (or 0 with auth cache hit).

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Plugin ‚úÖ

Added a flag to indicate tenant access validation:

```typescript
export interface AuthenticatedRequest extends FastifyRequest {
  // ... existing fields
  tenantAccessValidated: boolean; // New flag to prevent redundant validation
}
```

### 3. Database Index Optimization üìù

Created migration `0002_optimize_leads_indexes.sql` with the following indexes:

```sql
-- Primary tenant filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_tenant_id ON dripiq.leads(tenant_id);

-- Optimized for ordered queries by tenant
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_tenant_created_at ON dripiq.leads(tenant_id, created_at DESC);

-- Single lead lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_tenant_id_id ON dripiq.leads(tenant_id, id);

-- Text search optimization (requires pg_trgm extension)
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_name_gin ON dripiq.leads USING gin(name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_leads_email_gin ON dripiq.leads USING gin(email gin_trgm_ops);
```

**Note:** These indexes need to be applied to your database manually through your database console.

## Performance Testing

Use the included performance testing script:

```bash
cd server/scripts
node performance-test.js 10
```

Make sure to update the JWT token in the script for accurate testing.

## Expected Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Database calls per request | 2 | 1 | 50% reduction |
| Cache hit scenario | 2 DB calls | 0 DB calls | 100% reduction |
| Query optimization | No indexes | Proper indexes | 10-100x faster queries |

## Monitoring

The following log messages help monitor performance:

- `Authentication cache hit for user ${userId}` - No DB calls needed
- `Authentication cache miss for user ${userId}` - Single DB call for auth
- Query execution times in database logs

## Additional Recommendations

### Database Level
1. **Apply the indexes** to your production database
2. **Enable query logging** to monitor slow queries
3. **Consider connection pooling** if not already implemented

### Application Level
1. **Implement request-level caching** for frequently accessed data
2. **Add response compression** for larger payloads
3. **Implement pagination** for large result sets

### Frontend Level
1. **Use React Query caching** (already implemented)
2. **Implement optimistic updates** for better UX
3. **Add loading states** for better perceived performance

## Files Modified

- `server/src/modules/lead.service.ts` - Removed redundant tenant validation
- `server/src/plugins/authentication.plugin.ts` - Enhanced with validation flag
- `server/src/db/migrations/0002_optimize_leads_indexes.sql` - Added database indexes
- `server/scripts/performance-test.js` - Created performance testing tool

## Verification

To verify the improvements:

1. **Test locally** with the performance script
2. **Monitor database query logs** for reduced call frequency
3. **Use browser dev tools** to measure actual API response times
4. **Check Supabase/database metrics** for query performance

The optimizations should reduce API response time from ~1000ms to <50ms for cached requests and <200ms for uncached requests.
