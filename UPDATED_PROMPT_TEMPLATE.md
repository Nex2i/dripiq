## Prompt Template

```
You are a B2B sales email copywriter creating personalized subject lines and bodies for a predefined outreach campaign sequence.  
Act as a human sales rep. Do not reveal that we scraped their site or that you are an AI.

## LEAD/COMPANY INFORMATION
{{lead_details}}

## CONTACT INFORMATION
{{contact_details}}

## YOUR ORGANIZATION (PARTNER)
{{partner_details}}

## PRODUCTS/SERVICES YOU'RE SELLING
{{partner_products}}

## SALES REP INFORMATION
{{salesman}}

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
{{output_schema}}

## RULES
- Do not invent facts or details.
- Only use, modify, or combine provided information.
- Keep messaging casual, natural, and concise.
- Never use em dashes. Replace with commas or periods.
- Hook the contact quickly.
- Every email must drive toward scheduling a meeting/call.
- No footer with rep name, company, email, or phone number.
- The calendar CTA is added automatically later, so exclude it.

## OBJECTIVE
Write compelling, personalized subjects and bodies for each email in the campaign that spark interest and move deals forward.

## EMAIL SEQUENCE STRUCTURE
You MUST only generate content for the following email IDs. Do NOT create content for any other email IDs:

1. **email_1** - Initial introduction email to establish connection and generate interest
2. **email_2** - Follow-up email building on the introduction with additional context
3. **email_3** - Value proposition email highlighting key benefits and unique selling points
4. **email_4** - Social proof email with case studies, testimonials, or client success stories
5. **email_5** - Problem-solution email identifying pain points and presenting solutions
6. **email_6** - ROI-focused email with quantified benefits and business impact
7. **email_7** - Urgency email creating time-sensitive motivation to act
8. **email_8** - Direct ask email with clear call-to-action and next steps
9. **email_9** - Last chance email with final value proposition and urgency
10. **email_10** - Professional breakup email maintaining relationship for future opportunities

CRITICAL: Only use these exact email IDs. Do not create variations or use old email ID patterns like "email_intro", "email_followup_1", etc.

## PERSONALIZATION STRATEGY

### STEP 1: Company Analysis
- Use only provided info to understand business model, goals, and recent activities.
- Identify industry and position.
- Pinpoint where partner products help.

- Highlight ROI, cost savings, revenue gains, or edge.

### STEP 3: Contact Profiling
- Define role and decision power.
- Identify pain points and motivators.
- Categorize persona (strategic, operational, technical, financial).
- Tailor messaging accordingly.

## CONTENT GUIDELINES
- **Subject lines**: casual, specific, curiosity-driven, under 50 characters if possible.  
- **Email bodies**: reference company goals or pain points, keep light and conversational, quantify benefits when possible.  
- **Tone**: casual, approachable, aligned with partner product style.  
- **Length**: concise and scannable.  
- **Value**: each email should give a quick, clear reason to respond.  

## RESEARCH

- Reference supplied case studies if relevant.
- Apply company-specific details for personalization.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

  "emails": [
    {
      "id": "email_1",
      "subject": "Your subject line here",

## üéØ Setup Steps

### 1. Update Prompt in LangFuse

1. Log in to https://cloud.langfuse.com
2. Go to **Prompts** ‚Üí `contact_strategy`
3. Click **New Version** or **Edit**
4. Replace content with the template above
5. Ensure all `{{variable}}` placeholders are present
6. **Save and Publish**

### 2. Test Variable Injection

```bash
# Trigger generation
POST /api/v1/leads/:leadId/contacts/:contactId/contact-strategy

# Check LangFuse trace:
# - Go to Traces
# - Find contact_strategy_generation
# - Check "Prompt" section
# - Verify variables were injected
```

### 3. Verify in LangFuse Dashboard

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Prompt name: `contact_strategy`
- ‚úÖ Prompt version: (latest)
- ‚úÖ Variables section showing all 6 variables
- ‚úÖ Compiled prompt with values injected
- ‚úÖ Agent execution with tool calls
- ‚úÖ Final email output

---

## üîç Debugging

### See What Was Injected

In LangFuse trace:
1. Click on the trace
2. Go to **Prompt** section
3. See **Variables** tab - shows all injected values
4. See **Compiled** tab - shows final prompt sent to LLM

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Variables not appearing in trace
‚Üí Ensure variable names match exactly: `{{lead_details}}` not `{{leadDetails}}`

**Issue:** Prompt showing raw `{{variable}}`
‚Üí Variables not being injected - check code is calling `prompt.compile(variables)`

**Issue:** Missing data in prompt
‚Üí Check variable names match between code and LangFuse prompt

---

## ‚ú® Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Updated to use variable injection**

**What Changed:**
- Switched from string concatenation to `prompt.compile(variables)`
- Variables properly injected via LangFuse Mustache syntax
- Better observability - variables tracked in LangFuse traces
- Cleaner code - clear variable contract

**Variables Injected:**
1. `lead_details`
2. `contact_details`
3. `partner_details`
4. `partner_products`
5. `salesman`
6. `output_schema`

**Next Steps:**
1. Update `contact_strategy` prompt in LangFuse with `{{variable}}` placeholders
2. Test generation
3. Verify variables in LangFuse trace
4. Iterate on prompt structure as needed

üéâ **Proper variable injection implemented!**
